## About the RNPDNO

Mexico's National Registry of Missing and Untraceable Persons (Registro Nacional de Personas Desaparecidas y No Localizadas, RNPDNO by its acronym in Spanish) is a centralized database that gathers information of missing and untraceable persons in Mexico. The RNPDNO is mainly fed from the information gathered by each state's Attorney and the (Federal) Attorney General's Office. Plus, the RNPDNO has a [public web app](https://versionpublicarnpdno.segob.gob.mx) where users can file a missing or uncontactable person report. 

The RNPDNO is maintained and administered by the National Search Commission (Comisión Nacional de Búsqueda, CNB by its acronym in Spanish), a government agency subordinated to Mexico's Ministry of the Interior (Secretaría de Gobernación).
